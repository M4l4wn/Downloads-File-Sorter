# You need to have Python installed on your machine in order for this script to work !
# This script sorts all the files in your Windows Downloads folder by their extension into directories with specific names. The directories are created in your ~Downloads folder. For example if you have a mess in your ~Downloads; many .pdf, .doc, .py, .mp3 and so on if you run the script they will be sorted into directories like "PDFs", "Word Documents", "Python Files", "MP3 Files" and so on.
# It won't affect folders and files within them that are in your ~Downloads folder. It affects only files that are directly into your ~Downloads folder.
# You can add more extensions to sort with a specified directory name into the "extensions" dictionary within the script. Personalize it yourself :D !
# If you move the run.bat file in other directory than the Python script is, it won't work. Please keep them togheder at all times !
# In the future maybe I will save the "extensions" dictionary into a JSON file which the script can read and add a .exe so it's more friendly for users that don't use Python. Stay tuned for updates !
